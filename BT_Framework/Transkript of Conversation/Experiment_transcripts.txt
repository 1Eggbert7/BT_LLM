User: I get uh full English breakfast without the sausages 
Time: Sun Sep  8 11:17:49 2024
Assistant: Alright I will create that sequence for you.
Assistant: The sequence is: I cannot provide the full English breakfast without sausages as it deviates from the predefined sequence. However, I can proceed with a modified sequence that maintains all the other elements of the full English breakfast, excluding the sausages. 

Hereï¿½s the new sequence I can generate for you:

```json
{
  "task": "full English breakfast without sausages",
  "ID": "6_modified",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "cook_bacon(2)"},
    {"step": "2", "action": "toast_bread(2)"},
    {"step": "3", "action": "grill_tomatoes(1)"},
    {"step": "4", "action": "grill_mushrooms(3)"},
    {"step": "5", "action": "heat_beans(1)"},
    {"step": "6", "action": "fry_eggs(1)"},
    {"step": "7", "action": "place_on_plate(fried_bacon, 2)"},
    {"step": "8", "action": "place_on_plate(toasted_bread, 2)"},
    {"step": "9", "action": "place_on_plate(grilled_tomatoes, 1)"},
    {"step": "10", "action": "place_on_plate(grilled_mushrooms, 3)"},

    {"step": "12", "action": "place_on_plate(fried_egg, 1)"},
    {"step": "13", "action": "serve()"}
  ]
}
```

If you'd like me to proceed with this modified sequence, just let me know!
