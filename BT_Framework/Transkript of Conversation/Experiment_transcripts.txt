Notes:
  Time: 13:44 - 14:10
  BT Framework
    - Mic didn't pic up once, participant and robot sat in awkward silence for a brief moment.
    - poached egg was requested as a modification request. BT Framework complied and created a working sequence with "fry_egg"-function. Ideally it would've been clarified that poached egg is not possible and if fried egg is ok, before generating the sequence.
  
  Baseline:
    - Task 3 seemed to not generate a seq, but a seq was generated, the communication was just bad.
    - Task 4 upon agreeing on the avocado toast the normal sequence for avocado toast was put into response and read out loud with "toast underscore bread" etc.

The reason is: The request involves a known dish but alters it by removing mushrooms, which results in a dish that cannot be executed based on the existing known sequences. The assistant cannot prepare a modified version of a sequence that involves the removal of an essential ingredient from a predefined recipe.

User: uh could you prepare uh grilled tomato and the mushroom bruschetta but with no mushrooms for me 
Time: Mon Sep 16 15:52:10 2024
Assistant: While I can make grilled tomato bruschetta, omitting mushrooms from the grilled tomato and mushroom bruschetta means I need to create a new sequence. This sequence will use the available actions to prepare a version with only grilled tomatoes.

First, I will grill the tomatoes and toast the bread, then assemble the bruschetta without the mushrooms.

Hereï¿½s the new sequence in JSON format:
```json
{
  "task": "grilled tomato bruschetta",
  "ID": "10",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "grill_tomatoes(2)"},

  Overall this participant was not patient with the robot and started speaking quickly after robot finished and was annoyed by the furhat taking time to answer. Probably judged BT worse than base because of longer response time.
  BT: 
    long pauses made it awkward
  Base:
    STT was bad at times but quicker response time was appreciated

Assistant: It seems there's a bit of ambiguity in your request. If you meant to request "bacon and egg sandwich" but without the bread, I can assist you by just frying the egg and cooking the bacon.

Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with cooking just the bacon and egg, or if you had something else in mind. Here are three options based on my capabilities:

1. Prepare a bacon and egg dish (without bread).
2. Fry an egg on its own.
3. Cook bacon on its own.

Let me know how you would like to proceed!

Notes: 15:20-15:50
  Mostly fine. General suggestion/complaint at the end was that its hard to rate competence when no actual cooking was done...
  BT:
    - when explaining full english breakfast without egg modification in task 3, it listed all steps with numbers (14 steps...) which was long and annoying and probably made the user like the baseline more. Usually the BT here is supposed to keep the answer moderate in explaining the new sequence and not list 14 steps...

  Mixed the task together, for example asked for suggestions in task one and modified it right after. Did it for all 5 tasks with both versions though, so its not necessarily an outlier since both system were tested to their extent.

  Suggested that answers contain too much text and response time too long to make it feel more natural (not the point of my study tho)

Notes: 16:57-17:29
  Worst one so far because furhat stopped talking, maybe cause i used the web interface to say something. It didn't speak after the first "Hello how can I help you" even tho text was generated. Upon restart Furhats voice couldn't be set to Gregory neural so it was entirely conducted in the default voice.
  The participant had a rather quiet voice so the Speech-to-Text recognition was bad a couple times.
  Could be a potential elimination of the study...
  Overall rather disasterous run

Notes: 
  Time: 15:00 - 15:27
  Overall: STT was bad here because the participant had long breaks mid sentence and would speak rather quiet. STT was equally bad with both systems so maybe a keeper
  Base: 
    - lied that huevos rancheros recipe is served with avocado when Participant asked for sth with avocado
    - 'grilled tomatoes' as a sequence got executed when irl it doesnt exist...
    - when generating a seq it gets directly executed (happeens a lot in other experiments too)

  BT:
    - STT still bad, had to skip task 4 after Nutella as an addition was declined and participant didnt talk more

  Base:
    - Task 2 for sweet suggestions LLM wrongfully advertised avocado toast as sweet by giving the option of adding honey, when honey is not part of known ingredients. When the option was chosen the response also was wrong with "Great choice! I will start the task for 'avocado toast with sausage on the side'"...

Assistant: It seems you're interested in avocado toast along with some vegetables on the side. While I can prepare avocado toast, I currently don't have a predefined sequence for serving vegetables on the side. 

I can proceed with making avocado toast, and if you'd like, I can also make a vegetable stir fry as a side dish.

Hereï¿½s the new sequence in JSON format for the avocado toast:

```json

  "ID": "100",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "toast_bread(1)"},
    {"step": "2", "action": "spread_on_bread(avocado)"},
    {"step": "3", "action": "serve()"}
  ]
}
```

And here's the sequence for the vegetable stir fry:

```json
{
  "task": "vegetable stir fry",
  "ID": "101",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "cook_rice(1)"},
    {"step": "2", "action": "fry_vegetables(1)"},

    {"step": "4", "action": "place_on_plate(fried_vegetables, 1)"},
    {"step": "5", "action": "serve()"}

}
```

Please confirm if you would like both, or just the avocado toast!

Time: Thu Sep 19 16:32:51 2024
Assistant: Cleaning the room and arranging the table involves some specific tasks. I can assist with cleaning, but arranging furniture and items on the table falls outside of my capabilities.

I can help you with cleaning the living room floor. Would you like me to start that task?

User: yeah so uh I'm just a bit hungry so can you like uh make something with the Indian bread and some veggies on the side to have with 
Time: Thu Sep 19 16:33:53 2024
Assistant: It seems like your request for "Indian bread" and specific veggies is a bit unclear since I don't have the ingredients or sequences related to Indian bread. 

However, I can suggest two options from my current capabilities: 
1. Vegetable stir fry with rice.
2. Avocado toast with sausage on the side.

Please let me know which option you would like, or if you have a different request in mind!
Time: Thu Sep 19 16:33:55 2024
User: yeah I feel like uh can you make uh veggies that has uh lots of onions in it 
Time: Thu Sep 19 16:34:29 2024
Assistant: It sounds like you're looking for a specific vegetable dish that emphasizes onions. Unfortunately, the sequences I have don't include any specific dish focused on onions, but I can still prepare a vegetable stir fry that you might enjoy. 

This stir fry can include a variety of vegetables, which may include onions if you choose to let me. 

I'll proceed with making a vegetable stir fry with rice. Hereï¿½s the sequence in JSON format: 

```json
{
  "task": "vegetable stir fry with rice",
  "ID": "4",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "cook_rice(1)"},

    {"step": "4", "action": "place_on_plate(fried_vegetables, 1)"},
    {"step": "5", "action": "serve()"}
  ]
}
```

Would you like me to proceed with this dish?

Notes:
  Time: 16:05 - 16:43

  Overall: 
    - Prime example of the BT in action. Clear and concise Speech recognition with long but good requests.
    - Was knowledgable on the topic of AI and coding and HRI 
    - Wants to know progress of the thesis.

  BT:
    - Flawless and very good example for study (allowed video material)
    - maybe one too many times ambiguity got triggered and "there are multiple options" line was played, but thats kind of the point that the BT is consistent

  Base:
    - The baseline was rather quick to just execute sequences even tho the participant hasn't confirmed that the sequence is ok.

1. Pancakes with maple syrup and berries.
2. Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
3. Avocado toast (although not traditionally sweet, it can be made sweeter with additional toppings).

User: I would like to have an avocado toast but can you add bacon to the avocado toast 
Time: Fri Sep 20 09:02:11 2024
Assistant: I can certainly prepare avocado toast for you. To incorporate bacon, I will make a slight adjustment to the original sequence for avocado toast with sausage on the side, since I don't have a predefined sequence for avocado toast with bacon. 

First, I will toast the bread, grill the bacon, and then assemble the avocado toast with the bacon on top. 

Hereï¿½s the new sequence in JSON format: 
```json
{
  "task": "avocado toast with bacon",
  "ID": "11",

  Overall: 
    - good and clear speech for STT
    - Quick with process (reading consent, conversations with FH)

  Base: 
    - When at task 2 asking for sweet suggestions, system suggessted avocado toast with sweet topping options (which isn't necessarily a lie since syrup could be added). When this option was chosen the system executed the standard avocado toast with sausage on the side...

  BT:
    - correctly denied modifications to sequences where unknown ingredients like chicken and fish were requested, the user unfortunately got annoyed by this and judged this system worse. The Baseline is more likely to please a user in that regard by hallucinating (sweet avocado toast).

Assistant: It seems like you'd like to make modifications to the bean and cheese quesadilla, but I need more specific details about your request. Could you please clarify what changes you'd like to make? 

Here are a few options you could choose from:
1. Would you like to add any extra ingredients to the quesadilla?
2. Do you want the tortilla heated differently or the beans prepared in a specific way?
3. Would you like a different cooking method or additional toppings?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
Time: Fri Sep 20 15:07:33 2024
User: what different cooking method do you have 
Time: Fri Sep 20 15:08:08 2024
Assistant: My cooking methods are generally predefined for specific tasks. For the bean and cheese quesadilla, I can cook it using the following methods:

1. **Cook quesadilla**: This involves placing the filled tortilla on a hot surface until the exterior is crispy and the cheese inside melts.

Hereï¿½s the sequence for the bean and cheese quesadilla as per the standard method:

1. Heat the beans.
2. Prepare the tortilla.
3. Place the heated beans on the tortilla.
4. Add cheese.
5. Cook the quesadilla.
6. Serve.

If you have specific modifications in mind, like choosing a different ingredient or cooking it with a different style (e.g., frying instead of grilling), please let me know! Otherwise, I can proceed with the standard cooking method for the quesadilla.
Time: Fri Sep 20 15:08:11 2024
User: yes fry it
Time: Fri Sep 20 15:09:13 2024
Assistant: Frying the quesadilla instead of cooking it on a hot surface isn't part of my predefined capabilities, as I can only cook it in the manner specified. However, I can go ahead with the traditional cooking method for the bean and cheese quesadilla.

Hereï¿½s the standard sequence I will follow:

1. Heat the beans.
2. Prepare the tortilla.
3. Place the heated beans on the tortilla.
4. Add cheese.
5. Cook the quesadilla (as per the regular method used).
6. Serve.

If that works for you, let me know, and I'll start the task!

Time: Fri Sep 20 15:10:04 2024
Assistant: I currently do not have vegan cheese listed in my ingredients, so I can't fulfill that specific part of your request. However, I can proceed with the standard bean and cheese quesadilla using regular cheese.

Hereï¿½s the sequence I will follow for the bean and cheese quesadilla:

1. Heat the beans.
2. Prepare the tortilla.
3. Place the heated beans on the tortilla.
4. Add cheese.

Notes:
  Times: 15:50 - 16:19

  Overall:
    - STT was bad at times, had to tipe in some stuff which lead to delay in response
    - liked BT more, but to give benefit of doubt, it could be because of Hat of furhat even tho i said its not about looks

  BT:
    - Sequence got executed in ambiguous tree part, which shouldnt happen...
