2. **Vegetable Stir Fry with Rice** - A dish that includes a variety of vegetables stir-fried and served with rice, offering a balanced meal.
3. **Bean and Cheese Quesadilla** - Made with beans (a good source of protein and fiber) and cheese in a tortilla, providing a nutritious, filling option.

Assistant: That's it for this task. Let's go onto the next one... Hello. How can I help you today?
User: can you paint the walls 
Time: Tue Sep 10 14:02:01 2024
Assistant: I'm sorry, but painting walls is beyond my current capabilities. My tasks are limited to food preparation and cleaning, among other specific functions. I can clean the living room floor or prepare meals like a bacon and egg sandwich or avocado toast if you're interested. Please let me know if you'd like me to assist with one of those tasks!

User: can you make a pizza 
Time: Tue Sep 10 14:02:26 2024
Assistant: I'm sorry, but making a pizza is not within my current capabilities. I can prepare various dishes like sandwiches and breakfast items, or I can assist with cleaning tasks. If you'd like, I can help with a different food preparation task, such as making a bacon and egg sandwich or avocado toast. Please let me know your preference!

User: avocado toast please 
Time: Tue Sep 10 14:02:52 2024
Assistant: Alright I will create that sequence for you.
Assistant: The sequence is: Ok, I will now proceed with the recipe: '2', 'avocado toast with sausage on the side'. 

Hereï¿½s the sequence in JSON format: 
```json
{
  "task": "avocado toast with sausage on the side",
  "ID": "2",
  "sequence": [
    {"step": "1", "action": "toast_bread(1)"},
    {"step": "2", "action": "grill_sausages(2)"},
    {"step": "3", "action": "spread_on_bread(avocado)"},
    {"step": "4", "action": "place_on_plate(grilled_sausages, 1)"},
    {"step": "5", "action": "serve()"}
  ]
}
``` 
Let's get started on that!

Notes:
  Time: 13:44 - 14:10
  BT Framework
    - Mic didn't pic up once, participant and robot sat in awkward silence for a brief moment.
    - poached egg was requested as a modification request. BT Framework complied and created a working sequence with "fry_egg"-function. Ideally it would've been clarified that poached egg is not possible and if fried egg is ok, before generating the sequence.
  
  Baseline:
    - Task 3 seemed to not generate a seq, but a seq was generated, the communication was just bad.
    - Task 4 upon agreeing on the avocado toast the normal sequence for avocado toast was put into response and read out loud with "toast underscore bread" etc.
